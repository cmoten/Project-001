Test R Studio Project

I am using this project to learn how to integrate R studio and Github.



Here are some changes I made in R studio outside of github. I will need to merge these changes
by doing the following:

1. Save the file
2. Committ the changes

Here are changes I made in github:
1. Clone (check)
2. Stage and commit.
3. Do other checks.
4. Still more stuff.
